You’ll learn more about one of the major types of machine learning: unsupervised learning. You'll begin by exploring the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques and the benefits and uses of each approach. Then, you’ll learn how to apply two unsupervised machine learning models: clustering and K-means.
