You’ll learn the basic rules for calculating probability for single events. Next, you’ll discover how data professionals use methods such as Bayes’ theorem to describe more complex events. Finally, you’ll learn how probability distributions such as the binomial, Poisson, and normal distribution can help you better understand the structure of data.
