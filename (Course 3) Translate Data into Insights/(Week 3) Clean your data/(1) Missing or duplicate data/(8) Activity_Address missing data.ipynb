    "You are a financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked your team with identifying new business opportunities. To help them decide which future companies to invest in, you will provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as \"unicorns.\" Your client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.\n",
