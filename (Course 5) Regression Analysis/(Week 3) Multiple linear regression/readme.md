After simple regression, you’ll move on to a more complex regression model: multiple linear regression. You’ll consider how multiple regression builds on simple linear regression at every step of the modeling process. You’ll also get a preview of some key topics in machine learning: selection, overfitting, and the bias-variance tradeoff.
